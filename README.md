Real-Time Sign Language Recognition using Mediapipe and LSTMs
This project implements a sign language recognition system using Mediapipe, TensorFlow/Keras, and OpenCV. It enables you to collect sign language data, train a deep learning model, and predict gestures in real time through your webcam.

The system supports both Mediapipe Holistic (pose+hands+face) and Mediapipe Hands (hands only) pipelines, with additional angle-based features to improve recognition performance.

Features
Collects sign language data with real-time webcam capture.

Uses LSTM-based deep neural networks for sequential modeling of gestures.

Supports multiple operating modes:

collect – Record gesture data for training.

train – Train a model using collected data.

predict – Perform real-time sign prediction from webcam.

Saves dataset automatically in structured folders.

Includes data augmentation with hand joint angles.

Configurable for different gestures (actions list).

Requirements
Install the required libraries before running:

bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe tensorflow scikit-learn numpy
Usage
Modify the configuration section in the script to select your mode of operation:

python
MODE = "collect"   # "collect", "train", or "predict"
MP_MODE = "hands"  # "hands" or "holistic"
1. Data Collection
Run in collect mode to build a dataset:

bash
python main.py
Press keys during collection:

Space → Pause/Resume

n → Skip to next sequence

s → Skip to next action

q → Quit

Captured data will be saved in MP_Data/<action>/<sequence>/<frame>.npy.

2. Training
Run in train mode to train the LSTM model:

bash
python main.py
The trained model will be saved as action.h5.

Training includes early stopping and learning rate scheduling.

3. Prediction
Run in predict mode to perform real-time recognition:

bash
python main.py
Prompts will appear to perform actions.

Predictions will be displayed live and logged in a list.

How It Works
Mediapipe extracts landmarks from hands, pose, and face.

Keypoints & angles form the feature vector per frame.

Sequences of feature vectors (~30 frames) represent one gesture.

An LSTM model learns temporal dependencies between frames.

Model predicts actions in real-time with softmax probabilities.

Adding New Gestures
Update the actions array in the code:

python
actions = np.array(['hello', 'indian', 'again', 'sign', 'man', 'woman'])
Collect new data with MODE="collect".

Retrain the model with MODE="train".

Future Improvements
Add more sign classes for a larger vocabulary.

Improve accuracy with attention-based models.

Export trained model to TensorFlow Lite for mobile deployment.

Integrate with text-to-speech for accessibility tools.
